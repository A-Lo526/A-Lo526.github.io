        <strong>About Me</strong><br>
        My name is Aaron Lo. I am currently a student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/"> University of Rhode Island </a> majoring in Compter Enginnering.
        If I enjoy this current coding course I plan on switching my major to Computer Science. I like to play videogames which is partly why I'm very interested in coding.
        Sports are something that I never signed up for but I did play them often as a kid whether it be football, soccer, frisbee, or volleyball. As of now I like to just
        hang out with friends as much as I can. <br>
